# Stable-Diffusion-App
This project is a React application that leverages the Stable Diffusion model via API to generate images based on a given prompt.
The creation of this project is inspired by Nicholas Renotte's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l16wCsDglU.
The app was built to use the CPU (due to my lack of GPU) and some sacrifices had to be made, namely smaller and lower resolution images being generated.
This also results in the image taking significantly longer to generate, ranging from 7 to 10 minutes. I hope to extend this project to use a GPU in the future.
